# Bogoscheme Interpreter

This is an interpreter written for a simple version of Scheme called Bogoscheme, which nonetheless includes first-class functions and lexical scoping.

After 1) the lexing stage, the interpreter 2) converts the tokens into S-expressions, 3) converts the S-expressions into an abstract syntax tree, and 4) evaluates the AST and returns the result.

The lexer and parser were generated by `ocamllex` and `ocamlyacc` respectively.

This project was written in OCaml for labs 5 and 6 of Caltech's CS 11 course.
